            <InfoSection title="How Risk Scores Are Calculated">
                <p>The student risk score (0-100) is a composite metric designed to provide a quick overview of a student's potential challenges. It is calculated as follows:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
                    <li><strong>40% - Attendance:</strong> Based on the student's average attendance percentage. Lower attendance results in a higher risk contribution.</li>
                    <li><strong>40% - Test Scores:</strong> Based on the student's average test score. Lower scores result in a higher risk contribution.</li>
                    <li><strong>20% - Fee Status:</strong> A binary factor. If fees are currently due, this portion contributes the full 20 points to the risk score.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-2"><strong>AI Anomaly Detection:</strong> If enabled, student data is sent to the Gemini AI model. If an anomaly is detected (e.g., a sudden drop in performance), the total risk score is increased by 20% to flag the student for immediate review.</p>

            <InfoSection title="Privacy & Ethics">
                <p>This tool is intended for educational support and should be used responsibly. All data processing happens locally in your browser.</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4">
                    <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> CSV data is not uploaded to any server. When AI features are used, only anonymized, aggregated data points for a single student are sent to the Gemini API for analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethical Use:</strong> Risk scores are indicators, not definitive judgments. They should be used to start conversations and provide support, not for punitive measures. Always consider the individual student's context.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bias Awareness:</strong> AI models can reflect existing biases. Educators should use their professional judgment to interpret the AI's suggestions and analysis.</li>
